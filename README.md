The Happiness Detector utilized an existing emotion recognition model, which excelled in detecting happiness, into a specialized tool for identifying this emotion with high accuracy. Utilizing the TinyVGG architecture and data from the AffectNet dataset, the model was trained using 2500 happy faces images. The result is an effective Happiness Detector in real time that demonstrates significant improvements in recognizing happiness compared to the general emotion recognition model. This project showcases the advantages of tailoring models to specific emotional categories for enhanced accuracy and practical application.
